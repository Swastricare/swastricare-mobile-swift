> "Act as a Senior Product Designer. Refactor this view with a premium, immersive dark-mode aesthetic. Focus on these 4 pillars:
>
> 1. Glassmorphism & Depth: Replace flat containers with translucent backgrounds (Color.white.opacity(0.05)) and subtle stroke borders to create depth.
> 2. Visual Hierarchy: Make primary data points (numbers) Large & Bold (20pt+) to drive focus. Keep labels smaller and secondary.
> 3. Rich Visuals: Use tinted circular backgrounds for icons and gradients for progress bars/fills instead of flat solid colors.
> 4. Breathable Layout: Increase padding inside cards and spacing between sections to reduce clutter. Ensure strictly consistent alignment (left-aligned headers)."
