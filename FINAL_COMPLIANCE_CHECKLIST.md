## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (Non-Critical)

### 1. project.pbxproj Descriptions (Optional Fix)
**Status:** Minor mismatch with PrivacyInfo.plist
**Impact:** LOW - Apple uses PrivacyInfo.plist, not project.pbxproj
**Action:** Optional - Can fix for consistency but not required

**Mismatches:**
- Face ID: project.pbxproj has "For Security " (vague) vs plist has full description ✅ (plist is correct)
- HealthKit: project.pbxproj has shorter description vs plist has detailed ✅ (plist is correct)
- Photo Library: Not in project.pbxproj ✅ (but present in plist - this is fine)

**Recommendation:** Optional to sync, but not critical for approval.
